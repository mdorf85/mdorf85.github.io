  <div class="entry-content"><p>To get right into it, I was working in JavaScript, and it being JavaScript functions were within functions and it was a callback treat. Here&rsquo;s an excerpt:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>BEFORE</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'>    <span class="nx">eventRender</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">event</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">element</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>        <span class="nx">element</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">append</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="s2">&quot;&lt;span class=&#39;closon&#39;&gt;X&lt;/span&gt;&quot;</span> <span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'>          <span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;.closon&quot;</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">click</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>           <span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">this</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">parent</span><span class="p">().</span><span class="nx">remove</span><span class="p">();</span>
</span><span class='line'>        <span class="p">});</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>What I wanted to accomplish - but with zero success up to that point - was appending a <code>span</code> element after the page was loaded with a <code>class=&ldquo;closon&rdquo;</code> that comprised a single <strong>X</strong> to be used as an exit button in its parent <code>div</code>.</p>

<p>The problem as I learned from consulting everyone&rsquo;s good friend <a href='http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19393656/span-jquery-click-not-working'>Stack Overflow</a>, was that since the <code>span</code> was being added dynamically after the page loaded, there was no event handler for it.</p>

<p>The solution was Event Delegation.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>AFTER</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'>    <span class="nx">eventRender</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">event</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">element</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>        <span class="nx">element</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">append</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="s2">&quot;&lt;span class=&#39;closon&#39;&gt;X&lt;/span&gt;&quot;</span> <span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'>          <span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">document</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">on</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;click&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;.closon&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>           <span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">this</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">parent</span><span class="p">().</span><span class="nx">remove</span><span class="p">();</span>
</span><span class='line'>        <span class="p">});</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>By passing the second paramter, the event handler knows to listen for the &ldquo;click&rdquo; event and check to see if the trigger matches <code>&ldquo;.closon&rdquo;</code>.</p>

<p>With that I was able to click on the <strong>X</strong> and have the element disappear from the DOM. We had triggered the proper bubbling.</p>

<p>So badass:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&rsquo;s no secret that passing code in Ruby (or any other language) can be a pain when it eventually needs to be rendered in JavaScript. In Rails, specifically, there are several ways to go about the often painstaking process.</p>

<p>Rails comes with the method <code>escape_javascript</code> that goes under the popular monogrammatic alias <code>j</code>which you can utilize in your view. For instance:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>JavaScript in Rails Ex. 1</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="err">$</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;some_element&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">replaceWith</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;&lt;%=j render &#39;</span><span class="n">some</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">element_template</span><span class="s1">&#39; %&gt;&#39;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And that should work.</p>

<p>Another way to go about this, especially if you&rsquo;re working out of a database, is to parse your code to a json. This can be done on a per record basis using <code>to_json</code> of course. Because of their object literal notation, JSONs are a pleasure to deal with in JavaScript land.</p>

<p>Finally and most excitedly - not only because it is the inspiration for this post&rsquo;s title, but more so because I found it exceptionally easy to implement - is a nifty little gem called <a href="https://github.com/gazay/gon" target="_blank">gon</a>.</p>

<p>A brief sift through its documentation is all it takes for one to get the gist of it (something I&rsquo;ve really come to appreciate the more I deal with gems and libraries who either have overly meticulous documentation or on the flip side none to speak of at all). Here&rsquo;s how it works:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Include gem and bundle install.</li>
  <li>Add <code><%= include_gon %></code> to the application.html.erb file.</li>
  <li>Use it as such&#8230;</li>
</ol>


<p>In your respective controller:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>JavaScript in Rails Ex. 2</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">arr</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="o">]</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">gon</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">arr</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">arr</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nb">hash</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="ss">a</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">b</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">gon</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">hash</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">hash</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And that&rsquo;s it. You have access to <code>gon.arr</code> and <code>gon.hash</code> in your javascript files.</p>

<p>This convenient meandering through and about the asset pipeline in Rails can be a real timesaver. Thanks gon!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&rsquo;s been just over six weeks since I began my undertaking at The Flatiron School - right around the halfway mark - and I could not be happier with the progress I&rsquo;ve made. From basic programming in Ruby to building web applications using the Rails framework and now venturing into the unknown, once again, with JavaScript it really is astounding to think how much is crammable into a month and a half. As one might guess, this doesn&rsquo;t come without a lot of hard work at an unrelenting pace.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://www.vendoralley.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/doorsteps_logo_410x295.png" alt="Doorsteps Logo" height=400 width=400></p>

<p>With that in mind, it made my mentor meeting last Friday with Flatiron Alumnus Andrew Callahan all the more refreshing. Andrew, a graduate of Ruby-001, was kind enough to have me at his workplace, appropriately tucked away in the Flatiron District. Andrew, after a 9-month long stint programming for Skift (a travel website) right out of Flatiron, is a software engineer at the startup <a href="http://www.doorsteps.com" target="_blank">Doorsteps</a>.</p>

<p>Doorsteps has set out to make the process of how people find, finance and buy homes easier and a more pleasant one. For consumers this comes at no cost. On the seller side, there are various financial plans available. What Doorsteps offers is a state of the art front-end design making the task of searching for and/or browsing real estate more user friendly and easier on the eyes than alternatives, like say, Craigslist.</p>

<p>Upon my arrival, Andrew ushered me into a room with a large table set up with oversize monitors and able to accomodate several developers. We immediately got started on a &ldquo;story&rdquo;, aka a short snippet about some change that is to be made to the main application. Each story is designated both a priority and a star rating pertaining to its potential complexity. Although I was on hand with my keen programming senses and vast knowledge of web development, we thought it better to go with a 1-star (lowest difficulty) task. This was, in short, to remove the &ldquo;Created At&rdquo; field for property show pages as product management deemed it potentially suggestive of old and/or outdated listings.</p>

<p>By the way, Doorsteps uses a nifty project management suite called <a href="http://www.pivotaltracker.com/" target="_blank">Pivotal Tracker</a> to implement the aforementioned system. From there we took to Git-catered version control, checking out a new branch to begin the removal of &ldquo;Created At&rdquo; in the Rails-frameworked application. In the spirit of test driven development, after paging through Sublime Text tabs and eliminating lines of Haml (an alternative to ERB) in view files, we made sure to remove any corresponding tests in RSpec. As has been my experience with nearly every foray into programming I&rsquo;ve had, results other than those that were solely intended came from the changes that we made. Namely, some logic governing the difference between posts of individual realty units versus larger properties had to be addressed. A slight tweak of an <code>if-else</code> statement later, and everything appeared to be in working order. End of story, so to speak.</p>

<p>As Andrew reiterated, this workflow was very representative of what he does at Doorsteps. I had a number of takeaways from being exposed to this bit of &ldquo;real life&rdquo; development, but first and foremost was that everything we did, to varied extents, has been taught and instilled in us at Flatiron. Guess we haven&rsquo;t just been solving labs by the dozens for the hell of it after all - big relief! But seriously, it really left an impression with me how much of what we have learned in our small time at Flatiron has equipped us for the workforce. Beyond this realization, I also was happy to have found the work not only productive and efficient, but rewarding and fun. Wielding the power to make immediate changes and impact on such a large project is a real privilege.</p>

<p>Doorsteps was recently acquired by Move, Inc., operators of the leading real estate provider site <a href="http://www.realtor.com/" target="_blank">realtor.com®</a>. This  should provide Doorsteps with a wealth of resources and the means to achieve its vision as a cornerstone in the realty business in even quicker fashion. As such, there is a buzz about the office (detectable even on a Friday evening in a more so than usual vacant setting) and a general feeling of excitement toward what the future holds. Thanks to Flatiron&rsquo;s Mentor Program and Andrew&rsquo;s willingness to take the time to host me, I&rsquo;m grateful to have had the chance I did to participate and bear witness to it.</p>

      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Let&rsquo;s talk about Ruby&rsquo;s <strong>Mass Assignment</strong> feature.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Massignment&rdquo; as no one calls it to my knowledge, allows for the programmer to assign a mass number of things. Usually in a single step. Well, let&rsquo;s look at a few examples in the scope of just Ruby.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a thing you can do:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Massignment Ex. 1</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">c</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">#=&gt;a = 1   b = 2   c = 3</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Simple, intuitive and potentially useful.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s another thing one might do:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Massignment Ex. 2</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">abc_arr</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">c</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">#=&gt;a = 1   b = 2   c = 3</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">#=&gt;abc_arr = [1, 2, 3]</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Slightly less obvious. Well, this being Ruby, every operation yields a return value and mass assignment is no exception. As you can see, the assignment itself returns a value of the array of values that were assigned.</p>

<p>Neat.</p>

<p>Widening our scope from standalone Ruby console to any Rails-like environment, Mass Assignment takes on new roles. Particularly in the ever-relied on <code>params</code> hash in which values are assigned, for example, based on encoding in the URL of a HTTP GET request or from form data of a POST request.</p>

<p>So in the spirit of the latter, take a simple website form asking for the user&rsquo;s name that corresponds to a table with schema such as:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Massignment Ex. 3</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">string</span> <span class="ss">:name</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">boolean</span> <span class="ss">:admin</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">default</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kp">false</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">null</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kp">false</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Say in its corresponding Controller&rsquo;s code, something like this line existed:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Massignment Ex. 3</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="vi">@user</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">User</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">params</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="ss">:user</span><span class="o">]</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This means everything in the <code>params</code> hash will be mass assigned to the available attributes. An ill-intentioned user then might suspect - based on strong Rails conventions - that an <code>admin</code> attribute might exist and submit to the name form something roughly like:</p>

<p><form action="none" method="get">
  Name: <input type="text" name="example" value="user[name]=hacker&user[admin]=1" size="40" readonly><br>
</form></p>

<p>This could potentially be processed by the <code>params</code> hash as:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Massignment Ex. 3</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">params</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="ss">:name</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">&quot;hacker&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:admin</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And well you get the idea. The user has set his <code>admin</code> privilege to <code>true</code> and that&rsquo;s a bad thing.</p>

<p>As it so happened, all this was pointed out as a vulnerability when in early 2012, Egor Homakov <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/github-suspends-member-over-mass-assignment-hack-4010025556/" target="_blank">more or less did this</a> on Github (a rails-based codebase). He gave himself the ability to commit a file to the Ruby on Rails project, and added some harmless files and <a href ="https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/5239" target-"_blank">posts</a> before Github acted and eventually publicly thanked him for his illumination of the issue.</p>

<p>It was all kind of like:</p>

<p><img src="http://img-9gag-lol.9cache.com/photo/5262242_700b_v1.jpg"></p>

<p>Anyway that was all a couple years ago which in the coding world is like a couple lightyears ago and so solutions and fixes that I&rsquo;m likely not even aware of have near-vanquished this bug.  One simple mitigation is making use of the <code>attr_protected</code> tool which specifies what fields may <strong>never</strong> be mass-assigned. You can also use its opposite <code>attr_accessible</code>, which allows you to list those attributes that can be mass-assigned.</p>

<p>Futhermore, incorporating a gem known as <a href="https://github.com/rails/strong_parameters">Strong Parameters</a> will include these protections in your Model/Controller.</p>

<p>So yeah, Mass Assignment is an example of something that on the outside is a total intuitive timesaver, but as we learned:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&hellip;with great convenience comes great potential for a total fucking meltdown.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Or something.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Something that affects nearly every line of code you write, but tends not to receive too much attention is <strong>precedence</strong>, or the order in which operators are evaluated. Maybe that&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s a somewhat cut and dry subject. What I mean by that is, once you know or reference this&hellip;</p>

<p><a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.3/doc/syntax/precedence_rdoc.html">Ruby&rsquo;s Table of Precedence</a></p>

<p>&hellip;you&rsquo;re kind of all set.</p>

<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean moments won&rsquo;t arise when your code isn&rsquo;t working the way you&rsquo;d like and precedence ends up being the culprit.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a simple assignment example where you might expect one thing, but get something totally different:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Ex. 1 &#8220;and versus &&&#8221;</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="ow">and</span> <span class="n">b</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">4</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">&quot;a = </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">   b = </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="n">b</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">#=&gt;a = 2   b = 4</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Ok, sure. But what about this?</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Ex. 2 &#8220;and versus &&&#8221;</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="n">b</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">4</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">&quot;a = </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">   b = </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="n">b</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">#=&gt;a = 4   b = 4</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Woah&hellip;different.</p>

<p>Well, it makes perfect sense if you refer to your handy table of order of precedence. Here is what happens chronologically in Ex. 1:</p>

<p>1) the value 2 is assigned to the variable &lsquo;a&rsquo;<br>
2) the value 4 is assgined to the variable &lsquo;b&rsquo;</p>

<p>or</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Ex. 1 Expressed parenthetically</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="ow">and</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">b</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Since &lsquo;=&rsquo; has a greater precedence than &lsquo;and&rsquo; this makese sense.</p>

<p>In Ex. 2:</p>

<p>1) the value 4 is assigned to the variable &lsquo;b&rsquo;<br>
2) &lsquo;2 &amp;&amp; 4&rsquo; is evaluated, returning 4<br>
3) the value 4 is assigned to the variable &lsquo;a&rsquo;</p>

<p>or</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Ex. 2 Expressed parenthetically</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">2</span> <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">b</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">))</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">2</span> <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1">#simplified</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Once again it all comes down to &lsquo;&amp;&amp;&rsquo; having a higher order of precedence than &lsquo;=&rsquo; whereas that of &lsquo;and&rsquo; is lower than that of &lsquo;=&rsquo;.</p>

<p>In step 2 in Example 2 you&rsquo;ll notice that &lsquo;2 &amp;&amp; 4&rsquo; returns &lsquo;4&rsquo;. That is due to the <strong>Associativity</strong> of &lsquo;&amp;&amp;&rsquo; which is left-to-right. This means &lsquo;2&rsquo; is evaluated first, followed by &lsquo;4&rsquo; which is returned.</p>

<p>Finally, here&rsquo;s another quirk you might come across in Ruby&rsquo;s precedence rules:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Ex. 1 &#8220;&&/|| vs and/or&#8221;</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="kp">true</span> <span class="ow">or</span> <span class="kp">true</span> <span class="ow">and</span> <span class="kp">false</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">#=&gt;false</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>while</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Ex. 2 &#8220;&&/|| vs and/or&#8221;</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="kp">true</span> <span class="o">||</span> <span class="kp">true</span> <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="kp">false</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">#=&gt;true</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The difference in return values here boils down to &lsquo;and&rsquo; and &lsquo;or&rsquo; having identical precedence resulting in Ruby evaluating it left-to-right while &lsquo;&amp;&amp;&rsquo; having a higher precedence than &lsquo;||&rsquo; means &lsquo;true &amp;&amp; false&rsquo; receives first evaluation resulting in a &lsquo;true || false&rsquo; that returns true.</p>

<p>In precedence, as with everything else in Ruby there are no surprises, so long as you know what to expect.</p>
